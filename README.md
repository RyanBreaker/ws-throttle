# ws-throttle

A library and server for interacting
with [JMRI's WiThrottle TCP protocol](https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/Protocol.shtml).

Still early into development, this project's purpose is to provide models to reflect the interactions with JMRI as well
as a server to act as a middleman to translate those interactions to WebSockets.
