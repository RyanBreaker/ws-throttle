# ws-throttle

A library and server for interacting
with [JMRI's WiThrottle TCP protocol](https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/Protocol.shtml).

This project's purpose is to provide models to reflect the interactions with JMRI as well as a server implementation
using those models to act as a middleman to translate those interactions to WebSockets.
